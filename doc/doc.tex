\section{About}

Term project for course \textit{PA181 Services - Systems, Modeling and Execution}\footnote{\href{https://is.muni.cz/predmet/fi/jaro2019/PA181}{\color{urlcolor}{is.muni.cz/predmet/fi/jaro2019/PA181}}} in year 2019. Within the project, we had to create a fully functional application using the \textit{IBM Cloud}\footnote{\href{https://cloud.ibm.com/}{\color{urlcolor}{cloud.ibm.com}}} technology including a detailed documentation and a presentation. \textit{doc. Mouzhi Ge, Ph.D.}\footnote{\href{https://is.muni.cz/auth/osoba/239833}{\color{urlcolor}{is.muni.cz/auth/osoba/239833}}} is the project supervisor.

\section{Idea}

The core idea was to create and develop a useful and practical application. The application provide services for testing the users in a form of questions and answers. Users are able to test themselves via these questions by selecting the correct answers. There are severals tests in three different types of language (Czech, Slovak and English).

\section{Application initialization}

Firstly, we have chosen a stable, reliable and safe platform supporting team project development - GitHub. Furthermore, GitHub provides a version control system management and the integration with IBM Cloud is supported. Subsequently, after the repository was configured properly, we had to choose the technologies. We decided to use \#C (general-purpose, multi-paradigm and object oriented programming language) and React (library for building user interfaces) for the project. Also, we decided to use react Material-UI components for our UI. Based on the above, we have initialized the project skeleton - a \textit{'Hello, World!'} application.

\section{Application implementation}

The project was implemented via \textit{ASP.NET} framework using a Model--view--controller as an architectural pattern. The core UI was implemented in JavaScript using React library. This UI was later interconnected with backend. Our application supports an application log too to find easier the fatal failures. Our application was divided into few parts that communicate together and process requests - API, entities, repositories and services. The requests are firstly processed in the API, more precisely endpoint in controller. To process this request, the required actions are delegated to services (the business logic specific for our application is implemented here) that delegates the related subrequests to repository that provides the database communication using wrappers. \TODO

\section{Application deployment}

The deployment was configured before the core implementation itself. Deployment was initialized and configured on the already set \textit{'Hello, World!'} application. We wanted to create a fully automated delivery with zero intervention required, which allowed us to concentrate and focus on code only instead of problematic deployment. We were using a continuous delivery approach - automated build and deploy method via IBM's delivery pipeline. The delivery pipeline was configured to automatically install all required dependencies, build and deploy the application. The development process required to just commit the changes into the version control repository.\\

Whole deployment is based on one own properly configured DevOps toolchain. The toolchain is shown in Figure \ref{fig:toolchain}, which includes GitHub\footnote{\href{https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/ContinuousDelivery/toolchains\_integrations.html\#github}{\color{urlcolor}{console.bluemix.net/docs/services/ContinuousDelivery/toolchains\_integrations.html\#github}}}, Travis CI\footnote{\href{https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/ContinuousDelivery/toolchains\_integrations.html\#othertool}{\color{urlcolor}{console.bluemix.net/docs/services/ContinuousDelivery/toolchains\_integrations.html\#othertool}}} (as other tool) and Delivery Pipeline\footnote{\href{https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/ContinuousDelivery/toolchains\_integrations.html\#deliverypipeline}{\color{urlcolor}{console.bluemix.net/docs/services/ContinuousDelivery/toolchains\_integrations.html\#deliverypipeline}}}.

    \label{fig:toolchain}
\end{figure}

The toolchain providing a continuous delivery service allows us to focus on code only. After the continuous delivery toolchain was set properly, we just had to commit the changes to the repository and the application was immediately built and deployed.

\section{Application instructions}

\TODO: how to use, tutorial, examples

\section{Screenshots}

\TODO: images (add it to 'doc/img' folder - vector would be the best or raster with high resolution)

\section{Development issues}

During the project development we have faced a few problems that have been reported:
